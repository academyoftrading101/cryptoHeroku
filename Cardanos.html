      <h3 class="display-4 text-center">Cardano Price Prediction</h3>
      <p class="mt-5">
        Cardano   
      </p>
      <p>
        Here we will Mention about the price predictions for Short term and Long Term Perspective on basis of technical charts
      </p>
      <h3 id="reviewTitle" class="display-5 mt-5"></h3>
      <p id="reviewText" class="mt-5"></p>
      <h3 class="display-5 mt-5">Support (S) means : </h3>
      <p class="mt-5">
        In the financial world, support means a price level where the price stops falling again and again and takes an upward movement after hitting the price. In simple terms it is the price level where bulls get highly active and they do not let the market fall below this price level. Once the price goes below the support level , a psychological impact can be seen in the chat pattern. Now buyers are not more confident on that particular price on which one part of the market was strongly bullish.It also means that buyers have changed their mind on price (buying level) on that security and demand on that particular price goes down against supply quantity.
      </p>
      <h3 class="display-5 mt-5">Resistance (R) means</h3>
      <p class="mt-5">
        Resistance is just opposite to the support level. It is the price level from where the price of a particular stock, index or financial security starts to decline again and again. Most of the time we can see that price never breaks this level and goes upward. It is the price level where bears are hyperactive and start aggressive selling . This kind of situation does not let the market up easily. Once this resistance level is broken up, an upward breakout can be seen. But one should be careful with this breakout. It may be a fake breakout. Do not go bullish until you satisfy that the price which was resistance has become a support now and price is not going downward from this level.
      </p>
      <h3 class="display-5 mt-5">Why is there multiple supports and resistance ?</h3>
      <p class="mt-5">
        Many traders ask the same question as to why there are multiple resistance and support levels . we can understand it in simple terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let the price range as an orbit and stock price as a satellite which follows a range or path . if anyhow the satellite left his range or orbit .It is difficult for the satellite to come back in that range again. Similarly happens in the technical analysis. For a security it is hard to break its range which is its support and resistance level.Support and resistance create a price range in which stock swings. Once a stock moves beyond this support and resistance range , whether it is in upward movement or downward movement, a new class of range is set up. With change in price range , traders' price predictions also change and it causes multiple support and resistance levels in the market.
